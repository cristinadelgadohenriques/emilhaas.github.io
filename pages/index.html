        <h1>Ruinas de Valdés</h1>

          <p>This project´s aim is to give visibility to a problem that affects the whole rural environment of spain, which is the large amount of abandoned builldings and the regrettable state that most oft hem are in.</p>

          <p>Through an in-depth documentation of the ruins in the very limited geographical space of the Valdés council, in Asturias, northern Spain, a wider problem is shown, as this situation can be similar or even worse in other areas of the country, considering that this one is a coastal and touristic one.</p>

          <p>It is important to stress the no-profit nature of this space. We dont pretend to be anything similar to a real-estate agency, and don´t establish conections of any sort between buyers and sellers.</p>
